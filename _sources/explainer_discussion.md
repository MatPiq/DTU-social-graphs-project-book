Discussion
==========

In this section we will briefly touch upon the most pressing issues of our project. We split the discussion into X parts relating to:

(1) The quality of our data
(2) Others?

## 

Our results reveal several interesting aspects of how the disciplines relate to each other. First of all, the initial networks showed that while they are all to some extent connected to each other - there is a large degree of within discipline clustering. These results are quite robust also when doing community detection with the Louvain algorithm and node2vec. While we were able to find more communities than the amount of disciplines it seems that these communities mostly represent some sub-theme within a discipline. Interestingly, the node2vec projection showed that the relative distance between disciplines is varies with Economics and Anthropology being furthest apart, while Political Science and Sociology are more central. This suggesting that their distribution of connections to other fields is more even. Moreover, some

## The data

As Wikipedia - too some extent - is free to edit it becomes unclear what different editors might to believe falls under [Wikipedia's definition of the social scienes categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Society_and_social_sciences). If these differences between editors are truely random they might even out in the long run, but if there are systematically differences between the people editing the pages for the disciplines our comparisons of the disciplines will induce bias into our analysis.
