Discussion
==========

In this section we will briefly touch upon the most pressing issues of our project. We split the discussion into X parts relating to:

(1) The quality of our data
(2) Others?

# The data
As Wikipedia - too some extent - is free to edit it becomes unclear what different editors might to believe falls under [Wikipedia's definition of the social scienes categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Society_and_social_sciences). If these differences between editors are truely random they might even out in the long run, but if there are systematically differences between the people editing the pages for the disciplines our comparisons of the disciplines will induce bias into our analysis.
