    "As mentioned, we collected Wikipedia articles corresponding to the five major social science disciplines: Economics, Political Science, Anthropology, Sociology and Psychology. To understand how we did this one needs to know the structure of how information is stored into [categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Categories) on Wikipedia (very exciting!). Each category consists of several subcategories with even more sub-subcategories and on to infinity. Besides the subcategories each level of the depthness also contains the corresponding pages belonging to that level's subcategories. This is visualised in the image below."

    "Perhaps a specific depth level could be the key to an representative sampling strategy, we thought and so we used the tool [PetScan](https://petscan.wmflabs.org/) to access the articles at a predefined depth. This enabled us to find all the pages for each discipline depending on the depth of query which in our case were set to 2. A nice bonus to this approach is that Petscan can be accessed programmatically through Python and thus provide us with a relevant list of pages to collect from Wikipedia. A sort of structured way to sample from an otherwise chaotic encyclopedia. But now that we have the data, let's get serious."
