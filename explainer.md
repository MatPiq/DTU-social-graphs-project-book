Explainer Notebook
==================

This is the explainer notebook that contains our in-depth analysis of the social science wikipedia network including the code to collect the data and produce our results. If you have downloaded the data, you can run the notebooks yourself. Otherwise, all the cells have already been executed for you to see the output. We begin by outlining how the data was collected and processed. Next, we present descriptive statistics. This is followed by our network analysis and topic modelling. Next, we estimate word and node embeddings using `doc2vec` and `node2vec`. We finish with discussion of our results.
