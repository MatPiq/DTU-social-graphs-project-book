<p>As a last part of the analysis we wanted to test if it was possible to create a meaningful vector representation of our data in a vector space. To do so we used two techniques - <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">node2vec</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doc2vec</span></code> to model different aspect of the data. While they are similar to other methods we’ve used in the sense that they can help us understand patterns and relations in the data, they have the benefit of very easily being converted to a low dimensional space where one can calculate the similarities between units of analysis using for example the cosine or euclidian distance. The rest of this page is structured as follows: first, we compute the document embeddings and give a brief explanation of the method. Next, we do the same for node embeddings. We finish with visualization using UMAP. However, we think that the best way to interact and understand the embeddings is in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tensorboard</span></code></a> and we have hosted the data on the following two links below for you to play around with. We recommend testing both PCA and UMAP for dimensionality reduction.</p>

<h2>Document Embeddings<a class="headerlink" href="#document-embeddings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Document embeddings is an extension of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">word2vec</span></code> which allows us to estimate a vectorial representation of documents using shallow neural networks <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id15">Le and Mikolov, 2014</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id16">Mikolov <em>et al.</em>, 2013</a>]</span>. In our case the documents are represented by the Wikipedia articles corresponding to the social science disciplines. The task of the network is to predict a word <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w_t\)</span> based on a defined amount of surrounding words <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w_{t-\Delta}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w_{t+\Delta}\)</span> called the context, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\)</span> is the symmetric size of the context window. While this task is not necessarily very interesting in itself, it encourages the hidden layer to learn a numerical representation of the words that takes context into account. By also appending an indicator variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> to each Wikipedia page we simultaniously learn the representation of documents in the same latent vector space. In a paper by <a href="#id2"><span class="problematic" id="id3">:citep:`rheault2020word`</span></a> for example, they showed that one can extract high-quality representations of the ideology of politicians and parties using a parliamentary corpora that can also be used for a variety of downstream tasks. Borrowing <a href="#id4"><span class="problematic" id="id5">:citep:`rheault2020word`</span></a> figure we display the network architecture below.</p>
<img src="https://github.com/MatPiq/social-graphs-embeddings-data/blob/main/doc2vec.png?raw=true" width="800"> <p>To run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doc2vec</span></code> we first need to create a list of documents. Each document is a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">namedtuple</span></code> containing the text and the indicator variable for the article. We also set several hypyerparameters, the most important being the dimensions of the hidden layer <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vector_size</span></code>. Since the data is relatively small we set this to 100, common for larger corpuses being in the range of 200-300.</p>

<h2>Node Embeddings<a class="headerlink" href="#node-embeddings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Node2vec</span></code> was introduced in <a href="#id6"><span class="problematic" id="id7">:citep:`grover2016node2vec`</span></a> and is in many ways just like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doc2vec</span></code> explained above with the noteable difference that we are working with a graph instead of document of text. The trick of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">node2vec</span></code> is to first create a representation of the graph as a string that encodes the connection between nodes. As visualized below, this is done by taking random walks in the graph and letting the connections form artificial “sentences”. This leads to a data structure that can be passed to the normal <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">word2vec</span></code> model and generates one embedding corresponding to each node.</p>

<h2>Analysis of embeddings<a class="headerlink" href="#analysis-of-embeddings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Below we create two plot and reduce the dimensions of the embeddings using the Uniform Manifold Approximation Projection for Dimension Reduction technique (UMAP) introducted in <span id="id8">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id14">McInnes <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>]</span>. They show that Umap tends to be good at preserving the global structure of the embedding space while at the same time being fast.</p>
<p>Although one should probably be cautious when interpreting embeddings and especially their projections onto 2D-space, we generally find that both models have generated intuitive and useful representations of the data they were trained on. Moreover, the patterns to a large extent coincide with results from the previous methods we have implemented. In the plot based on node embeddings, the different disciplines are clearly clustered in groups. Looking at the y-axis, the disciplines furthest apart from each other are Economics and Anthropology, while Political Science and Sociology are mostly situated in the middle. One potential explanation for this pattern is their methodological and epistemological differences. Economics comes from a positivist tradition and mostly uses mathematics both in empirical and theoretical work while Anthropology is on the other side of the same spectra. Political Science and Sociology on the other hand, tend to use both quantitative and qualitative methods and be grounded in both interpretivism and positivism. A result that perhaps challenges this hypothesis is the proximity of Psychology and Anthropology. In this case, their relative positions rather seem to stem from overlap in subject matter rather than the particular methodological or epistemological approach.</p>

<p>At first glance, the document embeddings might seem completely random by the position of the points. However, when analysing the data closer we find this not to be the case. By looking at the neighbours of some Wikipedia page, i.e. the points closest in space, we find that they are often similar in content. As an example, if we look at the most similar pages to the Anthropology page <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_ethnography">mobile_ethnography</a> which is a qualitative method that utilizes smartphones we find pages similar to digital methods both in Anthropology and in other fields. In summary, we think that one possible interpretation of these findings is that academic disciplines, as understood through Wikipedia, tend to explicitly reference to their own discipline much more than to others. However, this cannot be fully explained by there being no overlap in substantive content as seen by the doc2vec results.</p>
