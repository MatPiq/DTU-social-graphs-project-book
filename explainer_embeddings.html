<p>In this notebook we outline the process of creating vector representations of the text in the wikipedia articles as well as their node in the network. The best way to interact and understand the embeddings is in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tensorboard</span></code></a> and we have hosted the data on the following two links bellow for you to play around with.

<p>The rest of this page is structured as follows: first, we compute the document embeddings and give a brief explanation of the method. Next, we do the same for node embeddings. We finish with an analysis of the document and node embeddings.</p>

<h2>Document Embeddings<a class="headerlink" href="#document-embeddings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Document embeddings is an extension of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">word2vec</span></code> which allows us to estimate a vectorial representation of documents using shallow neural networks <span id="id1">[]</span>. In our case the documents are represented by the wikipedia articles corresponding to the social science disciplines. The task of the network is to predict a word <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_k\)</span> based on a defined amount of surrounding words <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_{k-\Delta}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_{k+\Delta}\)</span> called the context, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\)</span> is the symmetric size of the context window. While this task is not very interesting in itself, it forces the hidden layer to learn a numerical representation of the words that takes context into account. By also including an indicator variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_{ck}\)</span> for each document we simultaniously learn the representation of documents in the same latent vector space. In a paper by by <a href="#id2"><span class="problematic" id="id3">:citep:`rheault2020word`</span></a> for example, they showed that one can extract meaningful representations of the ideology of politicians and parties using a parliamentary corpora. The gif bellow is borrowed from <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tsandefer/dsi_capstone_2">https://github.com/tsandefer/dsi_capstone_2</a> and shows the a simplified visualization of the architecture.</p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsandefer/dsi_capstone_2/master/images/model_path.gif" width="800"> <p>To run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doc2vec</span></code> we first need to create a list of documents. Each document is a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">namedtuple</span></code> containing the text and the indicator variable for the article. We also set several hypyerparameters, the most important being the dimensions of the hidden layer <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vector_size</span></code>. Since the data is relatively small we set this 64, common for larger corpuses being in the range of 200-300.</p>

<h2>Node Embeddings<a class="headerlink" href="#node-embeddings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Node2vec</span></code> was introduced in <a href="#id4"><span class="problematic" id="id5">:citep:`grover2016node2vec`</span></a> and is in many ways just like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doc2vec</span></code> explained above with the noteable difference that we are working with a graph instead of document of text. The trick of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">node2vec</span></code> is to first create a representation of the graph as a string that encodes the connection between nodes. As visualized bellow, this is done by taking random walks in the graph and letting the connections form artificial “sentences”. This leads to a data structure that can be passed to the normal <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">word2vec</span></code> model and generates one embedding corresponding to each node.</p>
<p><img alt="node" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1838/1*GbZk_M_HqCu8Y99J_FzhQw.gif" /></p>
<p>Before running the model we load the edge list and create the undirected <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">networkx</span></code> graph object and select the giant connected component.</p>

<h2>Analysis of embeddings<a class="headerlink" href="#analysis-of-embeddings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bellow we create two plot and reduce the dimensions of the embeddings using the Uniform Manifold Approximation Projection for Dimension Reduction technique (UMAP) introducted in <span id="id6">[]</span>. Umap has been shown to be good at preserving the global structure of the embedding space while at the same time being fast.</p>
<p>Some interesting patterns emerge from the data. In the plot based on node embeddings, the different disciplines are clearly grouped together. Looking at the y-axis furthest apart from each other are economics and anthropology, while political science and sociology are mostly situated in the middle. One potential explanation for this pattern is the methodological and epistemological differences. Economics comes from a positivist tradition and mostly uses mathematics both in empirical and theoretical work while</p>
