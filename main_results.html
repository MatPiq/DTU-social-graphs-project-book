<p>So what does this network tell us about the disciplines? Well it seems that religion is not only the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_of_the_people">opium of the of the people</a> but also for the social sciences as this it the most linked page across all disciplines. The network seemingly confirms one of many academic-stereotypes: Researches rarely care about anything outside their own field. The outlier here seems to be Sociology that makes a sympathic and honorable attempt at working as a middle-man linking knowledge from Psychology, Anthropology and Political Science. But even for sociologists the field of Economics are rather distinct except for the case of notable scholars as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell">Bertrand Russel</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls">John Rawls</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman">Daniel Kahneman</a> whose categorisation as economists are rather dubious to say the least. Likewise, our use of the advanced statistical technique <em>node2vec</em> confirms this, and goes even further by providing evidence suggesting that the classical opponents in Social Science, Economics and Anthropology, are as expected the least connected disciplines. Besides <em>node2vec</em>, we also use a technique called <em>doc2vec</em> to create a projection of the Wiki pages text. The distance between points can be interpreted as a metric of how similar they are. These so called “embeddings” can be seen in the plots below but we suggests following the links to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tensorboard</span></code> that offer a much better visualization</p>

<p>Pew that was a long scroll.. Now let’s take a look at the network. Generally speaking the pattern from our previous network is confirmed: The editors of disciplines’ pages on Wikipedia do really not like to link to pages from other disciplines! But it also reveals that the disciplines pages might not be as uniform as first anticipated. Community 1, 10 and 15 are rather unambigous communities of the Political Science category but they serve as a great example of the discipline’s heterogenity. On the one hand Community 15 illustrates the modern study of politics at the universities using scientific methods, whereas community 1 and 10 are two pages of a another subcategory we could label “ideology”. And even though they both revolve around political ideologies, they are widely different as one describes far-left/socialist tendencies whereas the other deals with far-right/libertarian pages. Our detection of communites therefore adds nuances to the painting of the social science landscape: Yes, they do not like to interact, but even within their own disciplinary most like to stay together in their small community of like-minded pages.</p>
<div class="section" id="okay-so-the-discipline-are-different-but-there-must-be-some-similiarites-right">
<h2>Okay.. So the discipline are different, but there must be some similiarites, right?<a class="headerlink" href="#okay-so-the-discipline-are-different-but-there-must-be-some-similiarites-right" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Paradoxically, a rather famous and widely applied theory in social science <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_identity_theory"><em>Social identity theory</em></a> can help us understand why all of the disciplines seem to think within the box. Originally put forward by <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Tajfel">Henri Tajfel</a> and his apprentice <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Turner_(psychologist)">John Turner</a> the theory explains how members of a group favorize persons similar to themselves, say sociologists, at the expense of the out-group members, say economists. Interestingly, the theory propose that one way to build bridge between people of different groups is by exposure to one another to discover their many similarities. A lesson we believe the editors of Wikipedia could learn a bit from.</p>
<p>Instead of only looking at how the Wikipeda pages were connected we decided to also look at their actual content. For this we ran a <em>topic-model</em>, a model similar to our community detection, but instead of relying on the networks structure it tries to partition the pages into different topics based on the pages’ <em>text</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="_images/topic_models.svg" /></p>
<p>The funny thing about these topics is, that although some clearly relates to only one disciplines, most of them are constituted by words of pages from more than one discipline. The most clear example of this is the topic we have decided to label <em>statistical methods</em>. When we qualitatively asses the pages of this topic we find a remarkable diversity in the discipline represented <a class="reference internal" href="explainer_topic_model.html#explainer-topic-model"><span class="std std-ref">hSBM Topic Modelling</span></a>. As this topic relates to the (statistical) methods used to genereate new knowledge it might suggest, that although the theory of the discplines might vary a bit, the ways they explore the world are fairly similar. What we are trying to say with this is that despite the disciplines cluster together on Wikipedia and stick to intra-disciplinary referencing, they are actually not that different from eatch other. Maybe we could all learn from Tajfel and Turn and enrichen our perspectives by seeing things from other angels.</p>
