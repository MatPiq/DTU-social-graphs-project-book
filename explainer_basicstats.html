<p>In this section we look further into some key properties of our network. Following our data collection we create an edgelist with all the wikipedia pages’ hyperlinks and a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pandas</span> <span class="pre">DataFrame</span></code> that contain additional data: the discipline of the page, the text of the page and its categories. To begin the inspection of our data we create a directed network, where each wikipeda page is a node and the hyperlink to other pages serves as edges.</p>

<p>Despite our effort to reduce the size of network by restricting it to only contain weekly component nodes as minimum (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_{in}\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_{out}\)</span> &gt; 1) it still yields quite a large network. This is due to the choice of our data collection strategy and the structure of wikiepdia where a lot pages might have several categorisations. To put out network under further scrutiny it is relevant to compute the in- and out-degree distributions.</p>

<p>When comparing the linear plots with the log-log plot, it is clear that our directed network have scale-free properties. The reason for this is that the degree distriubtion is well approximated by a linear model on a log-log scale suggesting that the degree distribution follows a power-law distribution (Barabási 2016). Formally the pow-law distribution can be expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Pk \sim\)</span> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k^{-\gamma}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_k\)</span> is the probability that a random node links to another node, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> is the degree exponent (Barabási 2016). If we rewrite the expression to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Pk_{out} \sim\)</span> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k^{-\gamma_{out}}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Pk_{in} \sim\)</span> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k^{-\gamma_{in}}\)</span> we can calculate the exponent for both of the distributions.</p>

<p>As the exponent corresponds to the slope of the straight line in a log-log plot, this means that the out-degree distrubution to a larger degree than the in-degree distrubitions is scale-free. So what does all of this entail in practice? Not surprinsgly for a collection of web documents, this suggests, that a few pages with alot of links are dominating the network.

<p>The inspection of the pages with high degrees reveal, that the keyword used for categorisation (Anthropology, Economicis, Sociology, Psycology and Political science) also have independent wikipedia pages. Naturally, a large share of the other pages refers to these, why four out of five discipline’s wikipedia page are among the pages with a highest in-degree. Given how much they distort our network we do not believe it is meaningful to keep them in our network. Likewise we also remove pages with “Index_of_” in the name.</p>
