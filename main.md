The website should be self-contained and tell the story of your dataset without the need for the Explainer Notebook (the purpose of the notebook is to provide additional details for interested readers). Here are some requirements

* The page should say clearly what the dataset is and give the reader some idea of its most important properties (kind of Project Assignment A-style).
* The page should contain your network and text analysis (that's the main part).
* There should be download options for data sets (so the user can play around).

Testing if citations work properly {cite}`holdgraf_rapid_2016`. Which they seem to do? and inline {:cite:p:}`1987:nelson`.
