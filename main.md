This part of the website is self-contained and where we tell the story of your dataset without the need for the Explainer Notebook. It focuses on some of our main results and includes several interactive plots for you (the reader) to play around with. In our project we were guided by the following questions:

* *How and to what are the social science disciplines connected in terms of referencing each other?*
* *Are relationships reciprocal or are some fields more central and influential than others?*
* *How does the language differ between diciplines? Are some more similar than others?*

To answer these questions we used wikipedia pages of theories, researchers and methods corresponding to each of the diciplines. The main part is organized as follows: first we introduce the dataset and very briefly explain how it was collected. Next, we display some of our most interesting findings and results.
