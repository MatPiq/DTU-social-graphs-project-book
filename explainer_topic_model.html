<p>In this section we introduce part of our text analysis, namely the part which pertains to our topic modelling approach. Topic models are mainly used to cluster a collection of documents into different so-called ‘topics’. In our analysis, we choose relevant topics, extract their topic distributions and visualize the results in different manners to demonstrate how and in which areas the different disciplines tend to interact on Wikipedia.</p>

<h2>hierarchical Stochastic Block Model (hSBM) Topic Modelling<a class="headerlink" href="#hierarchical-stochastic-block-model-hsbm-topic-modelling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Inspired by the approach set forth by <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id19">Gerlach <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>]</span>, we show the hierarchical clustering of documents and words from our Wikipedia dataset for all five scientific disciplines using a <strong>hierarchical Stochastic Block Model</strong> (hSBM). We only consider words that appear more than ten times in the text corpus and end up with 4302 articles or in our case, nodes. As opposed to other popular topic models such as LDA, we do not need to specify number of groups, levels or topics beforehand, since hSBM automatically detects these parameters. The model is inspired by community detection in networks and creates a bipartite-like network of words and documents. It splits the network into groups on different hierarchical levels organized as a tree. On each level, the hSBM clusters the documents and words in varying group sizes.</p>
<p>We have fed the model with data consisting of preprocessed tokens from each Wikipedia article where we remove infrequent tokens with a threshold at minimum 10 occurences per token. We are able to extract the documents from the model using the document number which corresponds to the index from our dataframe. We have merged the title of each article with the discipline from which it originates i.e. ‘Voter Turnout’ becomes ‘political_science-voter_turnout, which we need for the forthcoming analysis. The model has been trained in Google Colab due to ressource limitations using the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># our text data
docs = df[&#39;tokens&#39;]

# remove infrequent words.
cutoff = 5
c = Counter()
for doc in docs:
    c.update(Counter(doc))
vocab = c.most_common(25000)
vocab = set([w for w,count in vocab if count&gt;10])
# remove words 
docs = [[w for w in doc if w in vocab] for doc in docs]

# we create an instance of the sbmtm-class
model = sbmtm()

# we have to create the word-document network from the corpus
model.make_graph(docs,documents=[&#39;%d&#39;%i for i in range(len(docs))])

# fit the model
gt.seed_rng(32) ## seed for graph-tool&#39;s random number generator --&gt; same results
model.fit()

# generate topics at level 1
topics_l1 = loaded_model.topics(l=1,n=20) ```
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We have experimented with extracting topics at different levels of the model (our model has 7 levels). Generally, we find that the topics at level 1 are the most cohesive and specific which is useful for our analysis. We specify that the model should return the 20 most probable words per topic (remember the model itself chooses number of topics). The model generates 76 topics on level 1 which span from very method-related to more theme or topic-specific such as ‘socialism’ or ‘US politics’. On level 2, we find 15 topics which are more discipline-related and broader. The lower the level, the less semantically cohesive the topics. We have exported the level 1 topics generated by the model from the colab notebook alongside the forthcoming visualizaion and model parameters.</p>

<p>The above image shows the structure of the model. On the left side, we have the documents and on the right side, we see the words. Compared to Gerlach et al.’s visualization (see link), we are not able to detect the different disciplines from this image, however we do find the division on the document-ax interesting as it seems to divide the documents into two overall sections. However we need a different approach to utilize this sort of model output, so instead we choose and name 10 topics from the level 1 topics for a deeper content analysis:</p>

<p>The topics are chosen based on word clusters we find semantically meaningful and interesting for our query at hand - we choose some we believe to be purely discipline-specific and some which we believe to capture some overlap between disciplines. Our analysis will therefore touch upon patterns and tendencies rather than generalize across our entire dataset. We choose to visualize the word-topics with bar plots of the word prabability distribution in each topic:</p>

<p>From the words, we are already able to get a general idea of what kind of topic to infer. We see that especially the first 3 words of each topic tend to be very contributing. Based on our knowledge of the different disciplines, we are able to get an overall sense of whether we are dealing with an interdisciplinary topic such as ‘statistical methods’ or a disciplinary topic such as cognitive psychology. We do however want to be certain in our assesment and since words tend to be ambiguous, we extract the topic distribution for each chosen topic and their relation to articles in our corpus to better understand the context of the different words. The titles above each plot have been chosen based on both the word clusters as well as the articles related to each topic.</p>

<p>For topic 7, we infer it to regard administrative science. While the most probable words are ‘law’, ‘power’, and ‘institution’, we also see how the topic is the majority contributor in an overweight of political science documents which suggest the topic to be mainly political science-related. This topic is one of our more or less ‘pure’ discipline topics. Let’s take a look at one of our more interdiciplinary topics:</p>

<p>Statistical methods is one of our most interdisciplinary topics as it is present in articles from multiple disciplines. We find in particular that articles from psychology, political science and economics are related to the topic suggesting that statistical methods is a topic of interdisciplinary character. Intuitively, this aligns with our understanding of the different disciplines as statistical inference and causality traditionally both are strived for in academic work from these fields and thus involve well-known methods related to this topic.
Since the distribution of Wikipedia articles between disciplines is skewed towards political science, we find many political science-related topics in general as well as articles in each topic. This will also be evident in the following section.</p>

<p>Remember that each small node represents an article and each large node represents a topic. The links are created if they have been determined by the hSBM model to be related to the given topic. Each discipline has been given a distinct color and the edged have been weighted with the probabilities of the topic being contributing to the given article.</p>
<p><strong>Inspection of the plot</strong>
The plot testifies to the dominance of politcal science in our dataset however, we also see pure psychological and anthropological topics. The anthropological topic is interesting since it doesn’t capture stereotypical topics within anthropology but rather captures the archaeological and historical part of the discipline.</p>
<p>While we had expected to see more overlaps between articles across topics, this is merely a small subsample of the 76 topics which the model generated from the corpus. We do however see links between topics which are dominated by economics articles. The intersecting nodes are different lists of scholars or topics except one which pertains to economic power. We do not find this shared links to capture meaningful intersections between the chosen topics. It would have been interesting to look at all semantically cohesive topics from the model and see if more overlaps would be present. However, as the following section of our analysis will touch upon, the authors of the different Wikipedia articles do not seem to relate articles to other disciplines intentionally.</p>
<p>In summary: Overall such an analysis can provide us with an understanding of language similarities across documents. It provides us with an overview of the distribution of disciplines within topics and thus and opportunity to look at possible intersections such as the statistical methods-topic.</p>
