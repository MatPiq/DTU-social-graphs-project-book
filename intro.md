About this page
==============


This website is divided into two parts: (1) The [main section](main), which includes a self-contained story of our data. Including, our research question, a brief description of the data collection process and the main parts of the analysis. Part (2) is the [explainer notebooks](explainer), where we go into more detail and showcase the code used to generate our project. The data used in the project can be downloaded from this [zip file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ChfKERqmc41asg1dbKisEl3jMdNwxFPP/view?usp=sharing) which contains the following files:

1. A data frame containing the Wiki pages.
2. An edge list to create the network. 
3. A dictionary with node attributes.
