About this page
==============

Hello and welcome to our webpage about the five major social science disciplines on Wikipedia - are you as excited as us? Good!

Before we move on to the good stuff, there is some general information which we need to tell you. 
This website is divided into two parts: (1) The [main section](main), which includes a self-contained story of our data. Including, our research question, a brief description of the data collection process and the main parts of the analysis. Part (2) is the [explainer notebooks](explainer) (if you want to take a look under the hood), where we go into more detail and showcase the code used to generate our project. The data used in the project can be downloaded from this [zip file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ChfKERqmc41asg1dbKisEl3jMdNwxFPP/view?usp=sharing) which contains the following files:

1. A data frame containing the Wikipedia pages.
2. An edge list to create the network. 
3. A dictionary with node attributes.
