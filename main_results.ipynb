    "As a last step in our analysis we used `doc2vec` and `node2vec` to create a meaningful 100-dimensional vector representations of our data. The `doc2vec` model is fit on the text corpus while the `node2vec` model uses the hyperlink network, in both cases the each point represents one Wiki page. In this sense, they represent the same object but different kinds of relations between them. The document embeddings can be understood as the semantic similarity between the pages.  and the node embeddings the    To visualize the embeddings, we project it on a lower dimensional space using [tensorboard](https://tensorboard.dev/) and can be accessed through the following links:\n",
